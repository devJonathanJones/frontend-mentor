					<li>
						<span>Beat the eggs:</span> In a bowl, beat the eggs with  pinch of 
						salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon 
						of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium
						heat and add butter or oil.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, 
						pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the 
						edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen 
						fillings over one half of the omelette.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully 
						lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another 
						minute, then slide it onto a plate.
