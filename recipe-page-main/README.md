# Simple Omelette Recipe
Simple Frontend Mentor project. Just trying to freshen my memory of HTML and CSS after a bit of a break. I struggled at times to remember things but ultimately remembered pretty quickly. I'm happy with the result.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This project was built with just HTML and CSS. Nothing too fancy, just a quick little project to start off with. 

## Lessons Learned:

I already knew just about everything that I could've possibly learned from this project. But I was reminded of a few things I had forgotten in my break,


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
